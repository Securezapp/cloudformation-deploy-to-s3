# CloudFormation Deploy to S3

Before the official announcement for this deployment, if you wanted to deploy your SPA app, along with your other serverless services, just copy the contents from the `/example` folder and deploy.

**Note**: If you change your frontend folder from the current `web-site` into something else, be sure to replace it in its `template.yml` `SiteSource`, property `CodeUri`.
